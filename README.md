# cliffordhierarchy
Python implementations for enumerating all qubit/qudit gates of the Clifford hierarchy &amp; recognising and diagonalising semi-Clifford gates (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00127).

cliff.py - Code for enumerating gates of the Clifford hierarchy for n=1 qubit or qudit and checking if they are semi-Clifford
cliff2.py - Modifications for the n=2 case
twoqutrit-semiclifford.py - Numerically verifies that all two-qutrit third-level gates are semi-Clifford
